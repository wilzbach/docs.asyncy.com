# Quick Start

Our story begins with you, the developer. We believe in amplifying you to build and deploy applications at the speed of light. Our mission is to make development 10-100x easier by significantly reducing unnecessary complexity and focusing on what matters most: your story of data. Let's get started.

## Get started

First, install our CLI:

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center" width="100%" valign="top" colspan="2">
<details :open="$page.os === 'macos'">
<summary><h4><img src="../assets/apple-logo.svg" width="15"> macOS</h4></summary>

```shell
brew install asyncy/brew/asyncy
```

</details>
</td>
<!--
<td style="text-align:center" width="50%" valign="top">
<details :open="$page.os === 'windows'">
<summary><h4><img src="../assets/windows-logo.svg" width="15"> Windows</h4></summary>

Download the appropriate installer:

<div><a href="https://github.com/asyncy/cli/releases/download/0.0.6/asyncy-x64.exe" class="button">64-bit installer</a></div>
<div><a href="#" class="button">32-bit installer</a></div>

</details>
</td>
-->
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center" width="50%" valign="top">
<details :open="$page.os === 'unix' || $page.os === 'linux'">
<summary><h4><img src="../assets/ubuntu-logo.svg" width="15"> Ubuntu 16+</h4></summary>

```shell
snap install asyncy --classic
```

<small><a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap is available on other Linux OS.</a></small>

</details>
</td>
<td style="text-align:center" width="50%" valign="top">
<details :open="$page.os === 'unknown'">
<summary><h4>Direct from Python</h4></summary>

```shell
pip install --user asyncy
```

We **strongly recommend** using the other installation techniques.

</details>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Next, login with your GitHub account:

```shell
asyncy login
```

All done! You're all set to create and deploy apps written in Storyscript.

If you're having trouble logging in via GitHub, please [reach out to us](http://asyncy.click/slack).

<!-- TODO Feedback and question on how your experience was doing this. -->


## Write your first Story

Let's create your first application, to be able to check out the samples which are bundled.
```shell
mkdir first_app && cd first_app
```
```shell
asyncy apps create
```

> <small>Doing so will create `asyncy.yml` in the current directory. This file contains metadata about your new app.</small>

We have created a few examples that can help you bootstrap your project: Let's start you off with a simple hello world serverless http endpoint:

```shell
asyncy bootstrap http > http.story && cat http.story
```

```coffeescript
when http server listen method: 'get' path: '/' as request
    request write content: 'Hello world!'
```

Let's deploy this story:

```shell
asyncy deploy
```
```text
Compiling Stories...
Deploying app competent-nash-82.asyncyapp.com... |
√ Version 1 of your app has been queued for deployment

Waiting for deployment to complete... |
√ Deployed successfully!
If your story listens to HTTP requests, visit https://competent-nash-82.asyncyapp.com
```

:sparkles::cake::sparkles: Congratulations! You have just deployed your first Story!

`asyncy deploy` will deploy all the stories in your project at once.

::: tip See it live!

Check the deployment output.
It will indicate where your story was deployed.

:::

> **Next** Checkout our extensive documentation about [Storyscript](/storyscript/) to build powerful applications.

## Deploy changes

Ready to redeploy your application? We made it easy and intuitive.

Just run the same `deploy` command again:
```shell
asyncy deploy
```

:sparkles::cake::sparkles: Your application is now live!
